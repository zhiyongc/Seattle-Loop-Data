#### The data is collected by the inductive loop detectors deployed on freeways in Seattle area. The freeways contains I-5, I-405, I-90, and SR-520, shown in the above picture. This dataset contains spatio-temporal speed information of the freeway system. In the picture, each blue icon demonstrates loop detectors at a milepost. The speed information at a milepost is averaged from multiple loop detectors on the mainlanes in a same direction at the specific milepost. The time interval of the dataset is 5-minute.

#### The data download link contains a list of files:
* `speed_matrix_2015`: Loop Speed Matrix, which is a pickled file that can be read by pandas or other python packages.
* `Loop_Seattle_2015_A.npy`: Loop Adjacency Matrix, which is a numpy matrix to describe the traffic network structure as a graph. 
* `Loop_Seattle_2015_reachability_free_flow_Xmin.npy`: Loop Free-flow Reachability Matrix during X minites' drive.
* `nodes_loop_mp_list.csv`: List of loop detectors' milepost, with the same order of that in the Loop Speed Matrix.

A demo of the speed_matrix_2015 is shown as the following figure. The horizontal header denotes the milepost and the vertical header indicates the timestamps.

The name of each milepost header contains 11 characters:
  * 1 char: 'd' or 'i', i.e. decreasing direction or increasing direction.
  * 2-4 chars: route name, e.g. '405' demonstrates the route I-405.
  * 5-6 chars: 'es' has no meanings here.
  * 7-11 chars: milepost, e.g. '15036' demonstrates the 150.36 milepost.

### Update (2021 Jan.)
Three Seattle loop detector datasets (pickled files) are added to the download link. The formats of the three files is similar to the speed matrix file.
* `volume_avg_matrix_2015`: containing the **averaged volume** over all lanes of a road segment (a set of loop detectors)
* `volume_total_matrix_2015`: containing the **total volume** information (total volume = averaged volume * lane number)
* `occupancy_avg_matrix_2015`: containning the **averaged occupancy** information.
